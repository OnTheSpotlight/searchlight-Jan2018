I think that the problem I have with watching these last couple of seasons of “The X-Files” is that I want the show to feel the same as it did when I watched it back in the 1990’s. But, the simple truth of it is that it can’t--because too much has changed. David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson are both much older. The world has also changed, so the stories will be different. Worse of all, “The X-Files” is a reminder that I’ve grown older.

I have been watching the original episodes on FOXNow. I have favorite episodes, but there are also episodes which take me back to where I was when I first watched them. In the residence hall lounge, at a friend’s apartment.
